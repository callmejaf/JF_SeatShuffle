Dieses Script verhindert das automatische rutschen vom Beifahrer zum Fahrer f√ºr FiveM

Befehl: /rutschen

## Creator: https://github.com/callmejaf/JF_SeatShuffle

Completely rewritten my old script considering I actually know how to code now and it was littered with bugs

Enjoy!

HOW TO USE
As of the current latest version, the player will stay seated in their current seat. Be it, the passenger seat or the driver seat. If you press and hold your sprint button(Lshift[PC], X[PS] or A[XBOX]) it will shuffle you to the neighbouring seat. Alternatively you can type type /shuff to do the same thing
